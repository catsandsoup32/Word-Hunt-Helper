- waiting to get RPI camera working
    - then can get grid dataset

- want to get to a point where RPI can fully return solved grid
- this has to be reconstructed in Arduino C++ (should be fine)


- Need to figure out everything for motors
- 3D print (can do this one at a time)
- arms and joints
- Motor drivers
- IK
